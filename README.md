# AI+ SQL Bootcamp Materials
Materials for the AI+ SQL Bootcamp for Data Science

## Activity Sheets
This repository contains two markdown files -- an activity sheet without answers, and a separate answer key. 

_Note:_ Please try the activites yourself before checking the answers! There is often more than one right query to answer the question, and more than one valid way to interpret the question!

## Link to the database files
The two databases available for use are linked in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1cCvNkOz1IBGN2ge6Yv3A7KyPFRWs6G-J). The class activities ask questions about the `global_powerplants` database, and most questions can be answered in the `world_governance_indicators` database as well. I strongly recommend you practice using the second database after this course.

## Slides
Slides are linked in the google drive, and also uploaded here to github.
